After that, the `sparrot` command should be available from your command line.

## Whoxy

__The Whoxy Whois API is not free__ - you need to create an account and buy credits to use it.

After you've done that, get your API key from the "Account Manager" page.

## Usage

Pretty straightforward. Specify your API key and the domain from which you want to start:

```
sparrot -k [YOUR_KEY] target.com
```

__NOTE:__ If you want you can store the API key in the config file `~/.config/sparrot.toml`. It will be created when running sparrot for the first time.irst time.
